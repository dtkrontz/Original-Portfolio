                        <p>This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera.

                            We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. We'll play with clouds today. Just make a decision and let it go.
                            
                            Mountains are so simple, they're hard. What the devil. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves.
